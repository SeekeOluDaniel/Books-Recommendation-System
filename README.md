# Book Recommendation Platform : Project4
In this project, we are building a Recommendation Engine based on User ratings of Books. This will help readers decide their next read or can be adapted for their specific use cases.


The project can be run using following steps:
1. Generate the Pickle files  - Run Jupyter Notebooks to get the data in pickle files
2. Running the Flask Application - Run the app.py file to get the data
3. Website - The html page will by default display a Most Popular Books. There are pages to Recommend based on Book Titles, Recommend by User id , Search for a book and Data Insights


### Limitations
This engine uses a static set of data. Due to time constraints, we could not build a recommender system that can work with new data in this iteration of the project.

### Analysis
Our data sets include 3 csv files - Users, Books and Ratings
Our Recommender engine is focused on Collaborative Filtering (books similarity and user similarity)
